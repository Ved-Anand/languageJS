# languageJS
Got bored over winter break, was doing some coding and thought it would be pretty interesting to try to make my own coding language, so spent a few days doing that.
Amount I update this is fully dependent on my free time, mood, and investment which is always going to be changing. So far it can do basic variables, print statements, and 
been trying to do if statements (but this is still a very fresh thing and I've only been working on this two days as of me making this README). 

Currently lots of bugs and errors but I'm less focused on that and more focused on actually implementing "stuff". A parser for conditions is proving very difficult, for example being able
to take in var a = 3, var b = 2, and know that (a+b==5) should return true when its inputted. 

It's been pretty fun so far and a nice challenge to test my javascript proficiency.
